# Flask-React-Project (A )
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: [Skip to the  Description](#project-description)


## Testing

1. In the root folder, run `npm run backend` to start the backend server. This script is added to the "`package.json`" file on the root folder for ease of use
2. Run `npm start` to start the frontend server. In a moment the page should open up. If it doesnt, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on any browser

## Pre-word
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
To learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).<br>
To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).<br>

#### Progressive Web App in Mind
This Web App was made with the concept of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in mind. It is thus implemented as a completely mobile resonsive application.
Additionally, I used React for the front end to implement client-side routing. As such navigation throughout the application is still possible bar areas where a request to the server is necessary.<br>
The only thing required for the PWA path would to register a service worker. More details of making a PWA through `Create-React-App` can be found at this page: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app)

#### A word about the current state of the app
If you tried to test the application, it would appear pretty basic. In its current stage, priority was given to:
- Authentication and Security features, 
- Developing a good code structure to promote adding features and to reduce future development time,
  - e.g splitting code into directories "pages" for the different routes and "contexts" for [React Contexts](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), etc.
  - Moving all the code involving interaction with the API to a seperate class, available to use throughout the application
  - etc...
- ~~(And also... my own researching of different concepts involving the web and tools to pick the right choce for my project, along with learning the new languages involved.)~~

The TODO list for many further additions possible to the application is expressed in detail after the project description (skip [here](#todo-list) if impatient)
